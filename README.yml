        With the amount of data created everyday reaching exorbitant limits
        and a push for analysis across all major fields gaining traction, we need
        an advanced framework to analyze the large data. Hadoop is such a framework
        for developing distribution applications. MapReduce is an application model
        for Hadoop. Word count is a small analysis that can be done usingMapReduce.
        It can also be used for complex tasks like search.

        Like the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s, blockchain is a grossly misunderstood technology
        that has the capability of transforming a wide variety of industries. These industries extend 
        beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and includes healthcare and supply chain.
        This paper reviews the history and current status of blockchain and investigates use cases for 
        how blockchain can transform healthcare and supply chain.
