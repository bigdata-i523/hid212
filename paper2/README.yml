   abstract: >
        Like the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s, blockchain is a grossly misunderstood technology
        that has the capability of transforming a wide variety of industries. These industries extend 
        beyond just financial transactions and cryptocurrencies and includes healthcare and supply chain.

        how blockchain can transform healthcare and supply chain.
